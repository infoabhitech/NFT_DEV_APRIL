                <p className="main-p text-base text-left subpixel-antialiased">
                 At Rise&Fame we’re excited about a new age marketplace of tokenized Digital Products, Arts, Assets<br></br> also popularly known as NF T's (Non Fungible Tokens) in the digital world.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="main-p text-base text-left subpixel-antialiased">
                These tokens have compelling artistic side, are rare, tradable, transferable, with ownership that can be verified.
                And on a wider dimension, can provide unique opportunity for thriving Businesses, Brands to offer token based utilities, benefits and features to customers and community.
                </p>

                Just like physical goods, customers can do whatever they want with them!<br></br>

               * Enjoy the benefits and experiences which the Business has to offer to their NFT holders<br></br>
               * Seek NFTs as Digital Assets for investment purpose.<br></br>
               * Frame them as an art piece in living room.<br></br>
               * Get a new swag in social media platforms by putting them as display picture.<br></br>
               * Or at the best, showcase fandom, support to vision, mission of the brands they like, admire by buying those tokens.<br></br>
               * And, if they want to gift them to their friends, loved ones :)
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="main-p text-base text-left subpixel-antialiased">
                But unlike conventional physical goods, they are armed with the power of digital technology like BLOCKCHAIN. It’s innate property of transparency, encryption based security and traceability makes it a trusted, effective, quick way of conducting and tracking transactions, no matter how distant two parties are geographically located.
                </p>
                <br></br>   
                <p className="main-p text-base text-left subpixel-antialiased">
                We are building a platform that can connect and engage businesses with customers and communities and enable a new narrative of brand engagement.

                <p className="main-p text-base text-left subpixel-antialiased">
                We are glad to be among very few to pioneer such idea of Digital Asset Marketplace.
